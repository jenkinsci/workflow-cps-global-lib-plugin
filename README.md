# Pipeline Deprecated Groovy Libraries

This plugin is deprecated.
It implements a legacy mode of defining Groovy libraries in which there is a single Git repository hosted by Jenkins itself, to which you may push changes.
Instead use [**Pipeline: Groovy Libraries**](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-groovy-lib/).
