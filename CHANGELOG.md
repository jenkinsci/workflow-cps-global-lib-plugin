## 2.17

Release date: 2020-07-20

- Internal: Remove dependency on `commons-lang3` to avoid version conflicts with `jenkins-test-harness` in downstream projects. ([PR 94](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-global-lib-plugin/pull/94))
- Internal: Update minimum required Jenkins version and plugin dependencies. ([PR 95](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-global-lib-plugin/pull/95))

## 2.16

Release date: 2020-03-13

- Fix: Exclude the contents of `src/test/` in shared libraries from being used by Pipelines, as these files were likely only intended to be used in tests for the libraries rather than by Pipelines, and depending on the contents of `src/test/`, it may be unsafe for those files to be exposed to Pipelines. To restore the previous behavior that allowed access to files in src/test/, pass `-Dorg.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.libs.SCMSourceRetriever.INCLUDE_SRC_TEST_IN_LIBRARIES=true` to the java command used to start Jenkins. ([PR 91](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-global-lib-plugin/pull/91))
- Fix: Do not bundle JARs from Jenkins Apache HttpComponents Client 4.x API Plugin in this plugin ([PR 75](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-global-lib-plugin/pull/75))
- Fix: Trim leading and trailing whitespace when configuration the name or version of a shared library ([JENKINS-59527](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-59527))
- Improvement: Clarify that if the "Include @Library changes in job recent changes" option is checked, changes to the library will trigger builds of Pipelines that use the library ([PR 61](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-global-lib-plugin/pull/61))
- Internal: Migrate wiki content to GitHub ([PR 89](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-global-lib-plugin/pull/89))
- Internal: Add tests related to the criteria used to decide if an SCM is modern or legacy ([JENKINS-58964](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-58964))

Release date: 2018-10-02
-   Fix: [JENKINS-40109](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40109) -
    Make compilation errors in shared libraries serializable so that the
    actual compilation error is reported instead of
    a `NotSerializableException` in some cases.
-   Improvement: Implement support for SCM retry count.

## 2.11 

Release date: 2018-09-08
-   [JENKINS-53485](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-53485) -
    Fix a file leak introduced in version 2.10 of this plugin affecting
    all uses of the `libraryResource` step.

-   [JENKINS-52313](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52313) -
    Add an optional encoding argument to the `libraryResource`
    step. `Base64` is a supported encoding, and will cause the resource

    binary resources such as images when combined with Pipeline: Basic
    Steps 2.8.1 or higher.

-   [JENKINS-41497](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41497) -
    allow excluding shared libraries from changelogs (and therefore from
    SCM polling as well) via global configuration option

## 2.8 

Release date: 2017-04-24
-   Fixing some bugs affecting Windows-based masters (agent platform
    irrelevant):
    -   improper handling of CRNL in `*.txt` global variable help files

        libraries
    -   failure of class library access from `library` step depending on
        filesystem canonicalization

## 2.7 

Release date: 2017-03-03
-   [JENKINS-39450](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-39450)
    Added a `library` step as a dynamic alternative to `@Library` used
    since 2.3.

Release date: 2016-11-21
-   Related to
    [JENKINS-38517](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38517),
    checking out distinct libraries each into their own local
    workspaces, and improving parallelism in the case of concurrent
    builds.

## 2.4 

Release date: 2016-10-05
-   [JENKINS-38550](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38550)
    The **Modern SCM** option should not be shown unless some matching
    plugin is actually installed.
-   [JENKINS-38712](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38712)
    Library configuration screens used deep horizontal indentation.

    Supporting Grape (the `@Grab` annotation) from global shared
    libraries (internal or external).

## 2.2 

Release date: 2016-08-09
-   [JENKINS-34650](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-34650)
    Global library code now runs without the Groovy sandbox, so may
    provide safe encapsulations of privileged operations such as Jenkins
    API accesses. (Pushes to the library always required
    Overall/RunScripts anyway.)
-   [JENKINS-34008](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-34008)
    API allowing plugins to be notified of changes to the library.
