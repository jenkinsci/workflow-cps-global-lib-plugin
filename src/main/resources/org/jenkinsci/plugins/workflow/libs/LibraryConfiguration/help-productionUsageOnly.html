    If checked, library will be checked out only once regardless how many run of different pipeline jobs and will be stored only single place in jenkins_home. Please take backup of your jenkins_home for safety because once you enable this it will delete existing copy of library from workspace to cleanup unnecessary storage. Copy of library under every build folder in jobs directory will remain as it is. <code>@Library</code>.
