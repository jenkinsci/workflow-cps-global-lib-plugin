  Hosting of Pipeline Groovy libraries inside a Jenkins Git server.
  <strong>Deprecated</strong>. Use <b>Pipeline: Groovy Libraries</b> instead.
  If you see this plugin installed just because you upgraded, you can probably uninstall it now.
  This plugin should only be used if you have historically <em>pushed</em> libraries to a Git server inside Jenkins.
